Overview of acquisition functions.

`wavedump`
This program communicates with the CAEN DT5742 digitizer, takes data, and
stores it in an hdf5 file. Settings for the digitizer can either be set with a
config file given in the command line, or written into `wavedump.c`.

`acquire-waveforms`
This serves the same purpose as `wavedump`, except it takes data from the
Agilent oscilloscope. This format it uses to save the waveform data is outdated
(it does not store datasets in labeled groups).

`analyze-waveforms`
Interprets the hdf5 files generated from `wavedump`, makes charge histograms,
finds the sodium and SPE charges, and calculates the light output. Has the
ability to upload all relevant information to the database. `analyze-waveforms`
could be easily updated to also interpret the files from `acquire-waveforms`,
but `acquired-waveforms` needs to be updated first. 

`fit-histograms` (outdated)
Reads the root files generated from `analyze-waveforms`, and calculates the
charge of either the 511 or SPE signal. Can optionally store the data to a
temporary csv file. In the future, this data will be uploaded to the website
instead.

`save_charge_data.py` (outdated) 
Reads the temporary csv file generated by `fit-histograms`, and saves the data
to a more permanent csv file with more data included.

`dark_vs_laser.py` (outdated)
Reads data from the csv file generated by `save_charge_data.py`, and makes a
plot of the SPE charge over each channel for different methods of analysis. As
of now, Aug. 9 2022, it compares SPE charge measurements when using the laser,
and measurements from the dark counts using 3 different lengths of integration.
