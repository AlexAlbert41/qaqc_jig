Overview of acquisition functions.

`wavedump`
This program communicates with the CAEN DT5742 digitizer, takes data, and
stores it in an hdf5 file. Settings for the digitizer can either be set with a
config file given in the command line, or written into `wavedump.c`.

`acquire-waveforms`
This serves the same purpose as `wavedump`, except it takes data from the
Agilent oscilloscope.

`analyze-waveforms`
Interprets the hdf5 files generated from either `wavedump` or
`acquire-waveforms`, and makes plots of the signal and charge histograms.
Writes the histograms to a root file.

`fit-histograms`
Reads the root files generated from `analyze-waveforms`, and calculates the
charge of either the 511 or SPE signal. Can optionally store the data to a
temporary csv file. In the future, this data will be uploaded to the website
instead.

`save_charge_data.py`
Reads the temporary csv file generated by `fit-histograms`, and saves the data
to a more permanent csv file with more data included.

`SPE_FitScript.sh`
A script used to streamline the SPE waveform acqusition and analysis by running
`wavedump`, `analyze-waveforms`, `fit-histograms`, and `save_charge_data.py` back
to back. Also serves as an example for the intended use of these scripts. As of
now, Aug. 9 2022, it is configured to take SPE charge measurements with the
laser, as well as dark count measurements using 3 different lengths of
integration.

`dark_vs_laser.py`
Reads data from the csv file generated by `save_charge_data.py`, and makes a
plot of the SPE charge over each channel for different methods of analysis. As
of now, Aug. 9 2022, it compares SPE charge measurements when using the laser,
and measurements from the dark counts using 3 different lengths of integration.
