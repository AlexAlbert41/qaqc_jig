Installation
------------

These installation instructions have only been tested on Fedora 36 and Rocky
Linux 8.

First, you should install hdf5, numpy, scipy, psycopg2, root, and pyroot with either:

```
$ sudo dnf install hdf5 hdf5-devel python3-numpy python3-scipy python3-psycopg2 root python3-root python3-h5py python3-matplotlib
```

Then, install the dependencies

```
$ sudo make install-deps
```

Finally, you can build and install the wavedump program and the GUI:

```
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

Running
-------

You can run the wavedump software by running:

```
$ wavedump -b [barcode] -v [voltage] -o test.hdf5 -n 1000
```

Analyzing Results
-----------------

You can analyze the results by running:

```
$ analyze-waveforms test.hdf5 -o test.root --plot
```

Uploading Results
-----------------

First, you need to set an environment variable containing the password to the
database, and ideally add it to your .bashrc:

```
$ echo 'export BTL_DB_HOST=[HOSTNAME]' >> ~/.bashrc
$ echo 'export BTL_DB_PASS=[PASSWORD]' >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

You can analyze the results by running:

```
$ analyze-waveforms test.hdf5 -o test.root --upload
```
