Installation
------------

These installation instructions have only been tested on Fedora 36 and Rocky
Linux 8.

First, you should install hdf5, numpy, scipy, psycopg2, root, and pyroot with the following command:

```
$ sudo dnf install hdf5 hdf5-devel python3-numpy python3-scipy python3-psycopg2 root python3-root python3-h5py python3-matplotlib
```

Then, you can install the kernel modules and libraries required to talk to the
CAEN digitizer by running the following command:

```
$ sudo make install-deps
```

Note that the kernel module will need to be rebuilt if you ever update the
software on the computer!

Finally, you can build and install the wavedump program and the GUI:

```
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

Running
-------

Typical usage for the assembly center will involve running the GUI by running:

```console
$ qaqc-gui
```

Instructions for running the GUI can be found in the "QA/QC Jig For Dummies"
document. For the rest of the README I will describe the lower level commands
you can use to take data and analyze it.

The program `wavedump` is a program which takes data from the CAEN digitizer and writes out the data in the HDF5 file format. An example:

```
$ wavedump -o test.hdf5 -n 1000 -t self --threshold -0.1 -l spe
```

will take 1000 events triggering on the channels themselves at a threshold of
100 mV and will store the data in the dataset 'spe'. You can look at the raw
data by running:

```console
$ python
>>> import h5py
>>> import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
>>> import numpy as np
>>> f = h5py.File("test.hdf5","r")
>>> data = f['spe']['ch0'][0]/2**12
>>> data -= np.mean(data[:100]) # subtract baseline
>>> plt.plot(data)
>>> plt.show()
```

Analyzing Results
-----------------

You can analyze the results by running:

```
$ analyze-waveforms test.hdf5 -o test.root --plot
```

Uploading Results
-----------------

First, you need to set an environment variable containing the password to the
database, and ideally add it to your .bashrc:

```
$ echo 'export BTL_DB_HOST=[HOSTNAME]' >> ~/.bashrc
$ echo 'export BTL_DB_PASS=[PASSWORD]' >> ~/.bashrc
$ source ~/.bashrc
```

You can analyze the results by running:

```
$ analyze-waveforms test.hdf5 -o test.root --upload
```
